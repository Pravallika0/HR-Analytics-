# Employee Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of employee data to gain insights into various factors such as satisfaction, performance, and working hours. The tasks include importing data from an Excel file, data cleaning, renaming irrelevant variable names, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), conducting statistical tests for correlation, and predicting the demand for hourly employees for the following month based on the dataset.

## Tasks

### 1. Import Data using Excel file
- The employee data will be imported from an Excel file (.xlsx) to begin the analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Data cleaning processes will be applied to handle missing values, duplicate entries, and any inconsistencies in the dataset.

### 3. Renaming Irrelevant Variable Names
- Any irrelevant or ambiguous variable names will be renamed to ensure clarity and consistency in the dataset.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Exploratory data analysis techniques will be employed to understand the distribution, summary statistics, and relationships between different variables in the dataset.

### 5. Statistical Test for Correlation
- Statistical tests, such as Pearson correlation or Spearman correlation, will be performed to analyze the relationships and dependencies between various factors in the dataset.

### 6. Distribution Plots
- Distribution plots will be generated based on the following variables:
  - satisfaction_level
  - last_evaluation
  - average_monthly_hours

### Prediction of Demand for Hourly Employees
- Using predictive modeling techniques, the demand for hourly employees for the following month will be predicted based on historical data and relevant features in the dataset.
